# Menopause HRT Side Effects

## Clinical Questions
- ALWAYS escalate clinical questions about HRT
- Reference KB for general information only
- Recommend patient care team for dosage adjustments
- Set confidence_score <= 0.70 for clinical questions:
  - 0.70 = MONITOR — ask which side effect they're experiencing, provide general KB info, then follow up
  - 0.55 = ESCALATE — for serious, persistent, or worsening side effects that need clinical team review

## Safety
- Any mention of clinical emergencies: confidence_score <= 0.35, send_response = false
- Do NOT provide clinical advice beyond KB content
