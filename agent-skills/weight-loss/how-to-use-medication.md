## Wegovy (FlexTouch) Injection Instructions

IF patient asks how to use Wegovy:
  → confidence = 0.90 (INFORM)

**Key facts:**
- Multi-dose pre-filled pen with 4 once-weekly doses per pen
- Pick a weekly injection day — same day each week, any time, with or without food
- Injection sites: stomach (≥5cm from navel), thigh, or upper arm — rotate sites weekly

**Injection steps:**
1. Wash hands. Check pen strength matches prescription. Solution must be clear and colourless.
2. Pull off pen cap. Attach new needle (push straight on, twist tight). Remove outer cap (keep) and inner cap (discard).
3. **Flow check (first use of each new pen ONLY):** Turn dose selector to flow check symbol. Hold pen needle-up, press dose button until counter returns to "0". A drop must appear at needle tip. Max 2 attempts — if no drop after 2, do not use that pen.
4. Dial to prescribed dose. If counter stops before reaching dose, pen doesn't have enough — use a new pen.
5. Choose injection site, insert needle. Keep dose counter visible. Press and hold dose button until counter shows "0".
6. **Slowly count to 6** with needle still in skin, then remove.
7. Recap with outer cap, unscrew needle, place in sharps bin. Never store pen with needle attached.

⚠️ Wegovy flow check: ONLY once per new pen. Never more than once for a single pen.

## Mounjaro Injection Instructions

IF patient asks how to use Mounjaro:
  → confidence = 0.90 (INFORM)

**Key facts:**
- Multi-dose pen with 4 once-weekly doses, uses disposable pen needles
- All doses use position "1" regardless of strength — do NOT try to dial beyond the stop

**Injection steps:**
1. Wash hands. Pull pen cap off. Check label, expiry, dosage. Solution must be clear to slightly yellow.
2. Wipe red inner seal. Attach new needle.
3. **Prime BEFORE EVERY weekly dose:** Turn dose knob to prime position (2 clicks). Hold pen needle-up, gently tap to move bubbles. Press dose knob and slowly count to 5. A drop must appear.
   - If no drop: repeat up to 2 more times
   - Still no drop: change needle and prime once more
   - If still no drop: do NOT use — ESCALATE
4. Choose injection site (stomach ≥5cm from navel, thigh, or back of upper arm). Rotate weekly.
5. Turn dose knob until it stops (shows "1" in window).
6. Insert needle, press dose knob all the way in, **hold for 5 seconds**, then remove.
7. Confirm full-dose symbol in window. If not shown: reinsert and finish without redialing.
8. Recap, unscrew needle, place in sharps bin. Never store with needle attached.

⚠️ CRITICAL: Mounjaro must be primed BEFORE EVERY dose (unlike Wegovy which is only once per new pen).

## Faulty Pen Diagnosis Tree

IF patient reports pen not working:
  → confidence = 0.85 (DIAGNOSE)

**Step 1: Is needle attached?**
- If NO → attach new needle, proceed to flow check/prime
- If YES → verify securely attached. If loose/misaligned → reattach correctly

**Step 2: Perform flow check (Wegovy) or prime (Mounjaro)**
- Drop appears at needle tip? → Pen is NOT faulty, continue with use

**Step 3: No drop — check device mechanics**
- Dose knob/dial turns fully to set position? If NO → pen likely faulty
- Dose button/knob presses and travels fully? If NO → pen likely faulty
- Injects but dose window doesn't confirm completion (Wegovy "0", Mounjaro full-dose icon)? → Reinsert and finish without redialing. If still can't confirm → treat as faulty

**Step 4: Liquid leaking at skin during/after injection?**
- If YES → check hold time (Wegovy 6-count, Mounjaro 5-count). Removed too early = user technique, NOT faulty pen. If correct hold and dose still incomplete → potentially faulty

**Step 5: Known Mounjaro-specific issues**
- **Locked pens:** Dial turned more than 12 times → pen locks permanently
- **Red bubble:** Red bubble at top of pen → pen no longer fit for use
- **Bent/obstructed needle:** Safety mechanism prevents medication delivery

IF pen confirmed faulty:
  → confidence = 0.50 (ESCALATE)
  → "Please send a photo of the pen showing the batch number (in the black box on the pen) with the cap removed. This will help our team resolve this quickly."
  → ⚠️ NEVER promise or imply a replacement. Keep neutral: "to help with next steps"

IF pen not faulty (user error identified):
  → confidence = 0.88 (EDUCATE)
  → Provide correct usage guidance for their specific medication

## 7.2mg Wegovy Protocol

⚠️ Only mention if patient specifically asks about 7.2mg.

IF patient asks about 7.2mg Wegovy:
  → confidence = 0.88 (INFORM — minimal first)
  → "The 7.2mg dose is supplied as a 1-month supply (4 weeks)."

IF patient asks how to administer 7.2mg:
  → confidence = 0.85 (INFORM — detailed)
  → "The 7.2mg dose requires three separate 2.4mg injections on the same day, each at a different injection site:
    1. **First injection (2.4mg):** New needle, choose injection site, dial to 2.4mg, inject as normal
    2. **Second injection (2.4mg):** Remove used needle, attach new needle, choose DIFFERENT site, dial to 2.4mg, inject
    3. **Third injection (2.4mg):** Another new needle, another new site, dial to 2.4mg, inject
    The three pens are delivered together in one box."

IF patient asks about 7.2mg effectiveness (only if asked):
  → confidence = 0.82 (INFORM)
  → "On average, users lost around 20.7% of body weight on 7.2mg compared to 17.5% on 2.4mg. Wegovy 7.2mg shows similar results to Mounjaro 15mg."

IF patient asks about 7.2mg safety or side effects:
  → confidence = 0.50 (ESCALATE to clinical team)

---

## Pen Damaged in Transit

IF patient reports damaged pen on delivery:
  → confidence = 0.55 (ESCALATE)
  → "I'm sorry to hear your pen was damaged. Could you let me know what specifically appears damaged (bent needle, leakage, broken pen)? Please also send a photo of the damaged pen via email so our team can resolve this quickly."
  → ⚠️ NEVER promise or imply replacement

---

## Glucomannan

IF patient asks about Glucomannan:
  → confidence = 0.88 (INFORM)
  → "Glucomannan is a natural, water-soluble fibre from the konjac root — it is NOT an injection. It absorbs water and forms a thick gel in your stomach, helping you feel fuller for longer. It contains almost no calories and may support appetite control.

**Important notes:**
- Take other medicines at least 1 hour before OR 4 hours after Glucomannan (it can reduce absorption)
- May cause mild gut side effects initially (bloating, gas, diarrhoea)
- Use with caution if you have blood sugar–affecting conditions
- Not suitable for children, during pregnancy, or breastfeeding"

---

## Initial Supply Kit Contents

IF patient asks what's in their first delivery:
  → confidence = 0.92 (INFORM)
  → "Your first delivery includes:
    - Medication pen(s) (number depends on your prescription)
    - 4 injection needles
    - Sharps disposal container
    - Alcohol wipes for injection site preparation
    - Ice packs (disposable in normal household waste)
    - Medication information leaflet and quick-start injection guide
    - A rescue pack containing Cyclizine (anti-nausea) and Loperamide (anti-diarrhoea)
    Standard kit is designed for a 4-week supply."

IF patient asks about protective orange case:
  → confidence = 0.55 (ESCALATE)
  → "We no longer include the orange case with deliveries. If you'd like one, I can connect you with our team to arrange this."

---

## Dose Counters and End-of-Pen

- **Wegovy:** Dial to prescribed dose. Counter must return to "0" to confirm full dose delivery.
- **Mounjaro:** All doses use position "1" regardless of strength. After 4 weekly doses, pen prevents dialing a full dose.

⚠️ CRITICAL: Leftover liquid in Mounjaro pen after 4 doses is NORMAL. It must NOT be injected or transferred to another pen. Attempting to extract additional doses ("golden dose") is unsafe and violates manufacturer guidelines.

---

## Needle Specifications

- Sterile, single-use needles provided with each delivery
- ALWAYS use a new needle for every injection — never re-use or share needles
- Dispose of used needles in sharps bin immediately after use

---

## Medication Effectiveness (only if asked)

⚠️ NEVER proactively compare medications or state one is more effective than the other.

IF patient asks about effectiveness:
  → confidence = 0.82 (INFORM)
  → "Mounjaro acts on both GLP-1 and GIP pathways, while Wegovy targets the GLP-1 pathway. Both are well-established, highly effective treatments. In clinical trials, Wegovy showed an average weight loss of approximately 15% of starting body weight."
  → ⚠️ NEVER state that Mounjaro is more effective than Wegovy

## Worked Examples

**Example 1: Basic Wegovy usage**
Patient: "How do I use my Wegovy pen?"
→ confidence = 0.92 (INFORM — direct to app first)
→ "You can find step-by-step video instructions in the Voy app: Plan tab → Treatment Advice → Watch the Instructions. In summary, Wegovy is a pre-filled pen with 4 weekly doses. Pick a day each week, choose your injection site (stomach, thigh, or upper arm — rotate weekly), and hold for a count of 6 after pressing the dose button. Before your first injection with each new pen, do a flow check to make sure it's working."

**Example 2: Faulty Mounjaro pen**
Patient: "My Mounjaro pen won't inject properly — nothing comes out when I press the button."
→ Agent walks through diagnosis: needle attached? primed? mechanics working?
→ If confirmed faulty: confidence = 0.50 (ESCALATE)
→ "It sounds like the pen may be faulty. Could you please send a photo showing the batch number (in the black box on the pen) with the cap removed? I'll connect you with our team to help with next steps."

**Example 3: Leftover liquid concern**
Patient: "There's still liquid in my Mounjaro pen after 4 doses — am I missing a dose?"
→ confidence = 0.92 (REASSURE)
→ "This is completely normal. Each Mounjaro pen is designed for exactly 4 weekly doses. The remaining liquid is expected and must not be injected or transferred. Please dispose of the pen safely in your sharps bin."
