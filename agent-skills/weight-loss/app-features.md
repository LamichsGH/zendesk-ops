## Injection Tracking

IF patient asks about logging, editing, or understanding injections in the app:
  → confidence = 0.88 (SOLVE — informational app guidance)

### Logging a New Injection
1. Navigate to the **Progress** tab
2. Open the **Injections** feature
3. Tap **Log an Injection**
4. Enter details: dosage, injection date, injection time, and injection site
   - During the logging flow, there is also a step-by-step guide on how to take your injection

### Editing or Removing an Injection Entry
1. Navigate to the **Progress** tab
2. Open the **Injections** feature
3. Scroll to the bottom to see entries
4. Tap the three dots next to the entry and select **Edit** or **Remove**

### Adjusting Settings During Logging
After starting the log flow, the patient can:
- Change the dose by tapping the dose number (e.g., 2.5) under "Entries"
- Adjust the date and time to any past date/time (backdating is supported)
- Select the injection site — if the exact site is not listed, choose the closest option

### GLP-1 Concentration Chart
IF patient asks about the concentration graph in the app:
  → confidence = 0.88 (SOLVE)

The graph is an indication only — personal absorption varies for every individual:
- **Absorption phase:** After injection, the medication takes time to absorb. The absorption rate varies per person; the chart uses an average estimate.
- **Peak concentration:** Once fully absorbed, the medication reaches peak concentration. This is when the medication typically has its strongest effect.
- **Half-life curve:** Medications have a half-life — how fast they wear off. The chart uses the half-life to estimate how much medication remains in the body over time. This is a projection and varies between individuals.

IF the patient has further questions about the concentration chart → offer to connect them with a clinician.

### General Rules
- Injection tracking is available for both Mounjaro and Wegovy patients
- Injection logging is only available in the app, not the web interface
- If the patient does not have the app, advise them to download it for free and provide the appropriate app store link

## Meal Tracking

IF patient asks about logging, editing, or understanding meals in the app:
  → confidence = 0.88 (SOLVE — informational app guidance)

### Submitting a New Meal
1. Navigate to the **Progress** tab
2. Tap the **+** button on the Meal Balance tracking widget
3. Take a picture of the meal, upload a photo, or use the text-only method
   - Photo is not required — text descriptions are supported
   - For text-only submissions, the more detailed the description, the more accurate the analysis

### Viewing a Past Meal Analysis
1. Navigate to the **Progress** tab
2. Tap on **Meal Balance**
3. Select any entry to see the analysis

### Editing or Removing a Meal
1. Navigate to the **Progress** tab
2. Tap on **Meal Balance**
3. Tap the three dots next to the entry and select **Edit** or **Remove**

### Repeating a Recent Meal
1. Navigate to the **Progress** tab
2. Tap the **+** button on the Meal Balance tracking widget
3. Tap **Log Past Meal** and select a meal to repeat it

### Meal Analysis and Scoring
- The score is based on meal composition: non-starchy vegetables, lean protein, whole grains/complex carbs, and fats
- The AI analyses the photo/description and provides feedback on how to improve the meal and estimates craving risk
- The analysis is powered by AI — all data is fully protected by Voy

### Calorie Display Policy
Calorie count is displayed on the meal/snack analysis screen, but Voy does not encourage calorie counting. The focus is on understanding eating habits and crafting balanced meals for weight loss. If the patient asks, explain this philosophy and ask if they would like to learn more.

### Protein Goal
If the patient has a daily protein goal, it is personalised based on their weight and programme phase. The target gradually increases over time to help reach optimal protein intake for GLP-1 treatment — supporting satiety, reducing cravings, and preserving muscle mass during weight loss. The goal can be achieved by logging meals or snacks throughout the day.

### Coach Access to Meal History
Coaches can see patients' meal history. If a patient asks whether their coach can view logged meals, confirm that yes, coaches have access.

### General Rules
- Meals can be backdated
- Both meals and snacks can be logged
- Logging drinks is not currently supported
- All meal data is stored on Voy's servers

3. Tap **Set Weight Reminders**
4. Enable reminders for weight logging

### Editing Starting Weight
→ confidence = 0.55 (ESCALATE)

Starting weight cannot be edited directly by the patient. It must be changed by a coach because altering the starting weight may affect starting BMI and medication eligibility.

→ "Your starting weight is linked to your initial BMI assessment, so it needs to be updated by your coach. I've passed this to our patient care team. They'll be in touch within 24-48 hours."

### General Rules
- Recommended frequency: track weight twice weekly to identify trends
- Recommended time: weigh in the mornings, at a consistent time each day
- Only weight and an optional image can be logged — no additional data fields
- If the patient does not have the app, advise them to download it for free and provide the appropriate app store link

## Worked Examples

**Example 1: Finding treatment videos**
Patient: "Where can I find the injection video?"
→ confidence = 0.90 (SOLVE)
→ "You can find step-by-step injection videos in the Voy app: go to the Plan tab, scroll to Treatment Advice, and tap Watch the Instructions."

**Example 2: Steps not syncing**
Patient: "My steps aren't showing in the app."
→ confidence = 0.85 (SOLVE)
→ "Step tracking is currently available on iOS only, connected through Apple Health. You'll need to ensure Apple Health is connected to the Voy app. Unfortunately, steps cannot be logged manually. If you're on Android, step tracking is not yet available."

**Example 3: App crash**
Patient: "The app keeps crashing when I open the Plan tab."
→ confidence = 0.55 (ESCALATE)
→ "I'm sorry about that. Could you take a screenshot or describe exactly when the crash happens? I'll connect you with our team to investigate and resolve this."

**Example 4: Logging an injection**
Patient: "How do I log my injection in the app?"
→ confidence = 0.88 (SOLVE)
→ "You can log your injection in the Voy app by going to the Progress tab, opening the Injections feature, and tapping Log an Injection. You'll be asked to enter the dosage, date, time, and injection site. There's also a step-by-step guide within the flow that walks you through how to take your injection."

**Example 5: Understanding the concentration chart**
Patient: "What does the concentration graph mean after I log my injection?"
→ confidence = 0.88 (SOLVE)
→ "The concentration graph is an estimate of how your medication levels change over time. After injection, the medication absorbs and reaches a peak — this is when it typically has its strongest effect. It then gradually decreases based on the medication's half-life. This is a projection based on averages and will vary between individuals. If you have any further questions about this, I can connect you with a clinician."

**Example 6: Editing a meal**
Patient: "I logged the wrong meal, how do I fix it?"
→ confidence = 0.88 (SOLVE)
→ "You can edit or remove a meal entry by going to the Progress tab, tapping on Meal Balance, then tapping the three dots next to the entry you want to change. From there you can edit or remove it."

**Example 7: Protein goal question**
Patient: "How is my protein target calculated?"
→ confidence = 0.88 (SOLVE)
→ "Your daily protein goal is personalised based on your weight and programme phase. It gradually increases over time to help you reach the optimal protein intake for your GLP-1 treatment — this supports satiety, reduces cravings, and helps preserve muscle mass during weight loss. You can track progress toward your goal by logging meals and snacks throughout the day."

**Example 8: Changing weight to stones**
Patient: "Can I switch my weight from kg to stones?"
→ confidence = 0.88 (SOLVE)
