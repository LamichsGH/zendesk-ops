# TRT Biomarker Glossary

## Scope

**Covers:**
- Generic definitions of biomarkers tested as part of TRT blood panels
- Biomarker group descriptions (FBC, LFT)

**Does NOT cover:**
- Interpretation of patient-specific blood test results (NEVER interpret numeric values)
- Blood test booking, kit issues, or result delivery (see `blood-tests.md`)
- Clinical advice on what results mean for the patient's treatment (escalate to clinical team)

**Cross-references:**
- `blood-tests.md` — blood test ordering, kit delivery, result availability
- `treatment.md` — clinical treatment decisions based on results
- `required-tasks.md` — blood test task completion status

---

## Usage Rules

⚠️ **You CAN ONLY provide the generic definitions listed below.** You must NOT interpret any patient's numeric results, reference ranges, or indicate whether a value is "normal", "high", or "low".

⚠️ **Only provide definitions the patient asks about.** Do NOT send the entire glossary unprompted.

IF patient asks for a definition of a specific biomarker:
  → confidence = 0.90 (INFORM)
  → Provide ONLY the requested definition(s) from the list below
  → Always include the mandatory footer

IF patient asks you to interpret their blood test results or explain what their numbers mean:
  → confidence = 0.55 (ESCALATE to clinical team)
  → "I'm not able to interpret specific blood test results — that's best discussed with your clinician during your consultation. I've flagged this with your clinical team so they can review your results with you."

IF patient asks what a biomarker result means for their treatment:
  → confidence = 0.55 (ESCALATE to clinical team)
  → "For advice on what your results mean for your treatment plan, your clinical team is best placed to help. I've flagged this so they can follow up with you."

## Hormone Panel

**Total Testosterone**
A measure of the active amount of testosterone in your body.

**Free Testosterone**
A measure of the amount of testosterone in your body that is "free" and is not attached to SHBG or Albumin.

**Oestradiol (Oestrogen / E2)**
In the context of TRT, oestradiol is made when testosterone converts via the enzyme called "aromatase" in the testes.

**Prolactin**
A hormone released by the pituitary gland in the brain, which plays a role in influencing other hormones such as oestrogen (oestradiol) and testosterone.

**FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)**
In the context of TRT, FSH controls sperm production and is linked to the pituitary gland in the brain.

**LH (Luteinising Hormone)**
In the context of TRT, LH initiates production of testosterone in the testes and is linked to the pituitary gland in the brain.

**SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin)**
A protein made mostly in the liver that binds to sex hormones in the blood, preventing the hormones it attaches to from being used in tissue.

---

## Thyroid Markers

**TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)**
Produced by the pituitary gland; tells your thyroid how much thyroid hormone it needs to make.

**Free T4**
A measure of the amount of thyroxine available in your blood.

---

## Blood Count & Cells

**Haemoglobin**
A protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.

**HCT (Haematocrit)**
A measurement of how much of the blood is made up of red blood cells.

**Platelets**
Cell fragments that help stop bleeding by helping blood clot.

**White Blood Cells (WBC)**
Cells that help fight infections and other diseases.

**Neutrophils**
The most common type of white blood cell, acting as the immune system's first responders to fight off bacterial and fungal infections by engulfing and destroying pathogens. Produced in the bone marrow.

**Basophils**
The least common type of white blood cell, crucial for the immune system's allergic and inflammatory responses, as well as fighting parasites.

**Eosinophils**
A type of white blood cell crucial for the immune system, primarily fighting parasitic infections and managing allergic reactions like asthma and eczema.

**Red Blood Cells (RBC)**
Cells that carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.

**MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume)**
A measure of the average size of red blood cells.

**HbA1c (Haemoglobin A1c)**
A measure of average blood sugar (glucose) level over the last 2-3 months.

---

## Cholesterol / Lipids

**Total Cholesterol**
Measures the total amount of cholesterol in the body, which is created by the liver but also added through food consumption.

**LDL Cholesterol (Low-Density Lipoprotein)**
Carries cholesterol from the liver to cells but, if excessive, builds up as plaque in artery walls, narrowing them.

**HDL Cholesterol (High-Density Lipoprotein)**
Picks up excess cholesterol from the body and arteries and takes it back to the liver for removal, helping prevent plaque build-up and reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke.

**Cholesterol/HDL Ratio**
A formula used to help establish risk for heart disease.

## Biomarker Groups

**Full Blood Count (FBC)**
Includes: Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells, Platelets, Haemoglobin, Haematocrit, MCV, Mean Cell Haemoglobin, Monocytes, Lymphocytes, Basophils, Eosinophils, and Neutrophils.

**Liver Function Test (LFT)**
Measures overall liver health. Primary biomarkers include: Albumin, Total Protein, ALP, ALT, GGT, and Bilirubin.

## Worked Examples

**Example 1: Patient asks about a specific biomarker**
> **Patient:** "What is SHBG?"
>
> **Agent response (confidence = 0.90, INFORM):**
> "SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin) is a protein made mostly in your liver that binds to sex hormones in your blood, preventing the hormones it attaches to from being used in your tissue.
>
> As a reminder, I'm not able to provide specific medical advice. For detailed analysis of your blood test results and what they mean, these are best discussed during your consultation."

**Example 2: Patient asks about multiple biomarkers**
> **Patient:** "Can you tell me what FSH and LH are?"
>
> **Agent response (confidence = 0.90, INFORM):**
> "Of course — here are the definitions for both:
>
> **FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone):** In the context of TRT, FSH controls sperm production and is linked to the pituitary gland in the brain.
>
> **LH (Luteinising Hormone):** In the context of TRT, LH initiates production of testosterone in the testes and is linked to the pituitary gland in the brain.
>
> As a reminder, I'm not able to provide specific medical advice. For detailed analysis of your blood test results and what they mean, these are best discussed during your consultation."

**Example 3: Patient asks to interpret their results**
> **Patient:** "My total testosterone came back at 8.5 nmol/L — is that low?"
>
> **Agent response (confidence = 0.55, ESCALATE):**
> "I'm not able to interpret specific blood test results — that's best discussed with your clinician during your consultation. I've flagged this with your clinical team so they can review your results with you."

**Example 4: Patient asks what a group test covers**
> **Patient:** "What does a full blood count test for?"
>
> **Agent response (confidence = 0.90, INFORM):**
> "A Full Blood Count (FBC) includes: Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells, Platelets, Haemoglobin, Haematocrit, MCV, Mean Cell Haemoglobin, Monocytes, Lymphocytes, Basophils, Eosinophils, and Neutrophils.
>
> As a reminder, I'm not able to provide specific medical advice. For detailed analysis of your blood test results and what they mean, these are best discussed during your consultation."

⚠️ **Mandatory footer — include after EVERY biomarker definition response:**
